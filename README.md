# scrabble-c
This is a simple Command Line Scrabble game for me to get used to the C syntax
It closely mirrors the traditional Scrabble board game, as well as its mechanics

It uses a a trie created using words.csv to check if a given word exists
It also has checking if all connected letters/words for a given turn exists

TODO:
    - error handling
    - enable skip once player has chosen to play
    - file segregation for functions
    - use relative path for words.csv

What can be improved:
    End of game 
        - display the highest scoring word of each player
        - simple UI to show the ranking
